                    a significant role in bringing rainfall. Trees take care of the water cycle. Trees are also the

                    various birds and animals.</h4>

                    <h3>Mission</h3>
                    <p>Early initiatives understandably tended to become focused on those issues perceived to be of
                        particular
                        importance. Of these, the fuelwood shortage became far the most important.</p>

                    <h3>Vision</h3>
                    <p>A general conclusion from this earlier analytical work was that existing wood stocks were being
                        widely mined to meet fuelwood demand, that there was no feasible large scale alternative to wood
                        fuel.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Goal</h3>
                    <p>The growing focus on rural development did much to draw attention to the dependence of rural
                        people
                        on forests and trees. At the same time, the sharply increased concern with energy supplies.

                <p>Greta Thunberg, the famous and one of the youngest social activists did raise her concern over
                    environmental degradation yet her voice seemed to fall on deaf ears. Nobody paid heed to the
                    young
                    lady,
                    but the condition or our environment today invites an urgent need to draw our attention towards
                    these
                    plants, animals and forests</p>

                <h2>Global Community</h2>
                <p>Community forestry was initially defined, as any situation which intimately involves local
                    people
                    in a forestry activity. It embraces a spectrum of situations ranging from woodlots in areas which
                    are short
                    of wood and other forest products, to
                    provide
                    cash crops and the processing of products at the household,
                    to
                    generate income.</p>

                <h2>Stay Safe</h2>
                <p>The emergence of this rather narrowly circumscribed interpretation of participatory forestry has
                    also
                    tended to reinforce the tendency to treat the latter as a programme area definably different and
                    separate from existing programmes like forestry</p>
