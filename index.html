                    the
                    tree plays
                    a significant role in bringing rainfall. Trees take care of the water cycle. Trees are also the
                    shelter
                    for
                    various birds and animals.</h3>

                <h3>Community forestry was initially defined, as any situation which intimately involves local
                    people
                    in a forestry activity. It embraces a spectrum of situations ranging from woodlots in areas which
                    are short
                    of wood and other forest products, to
                    provide
                    cash crops and the processing of products at the household,
                    to
                    generate income.</h3>

                    also
                    tended to reinforce the tendency to treat the latter as a programme area definably different and
                    separate from existing programmes like forestry</h3>
